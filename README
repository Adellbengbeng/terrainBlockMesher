---------------------------------------------------

IWESOL contains libraries and tools for C++ and OpenFOAM.
In the version available here it contains:

1) The application 'terrainBlockMesher'

    This tool for OpenFOAM generates structured meshes
    over complex terrain. The latter has to be provided
    in form of a STL data file. It features

      - the basic mesh generation (ie, the generation 
        of an extensive blockMeshDict file),

      - the creation of an outer box around the STL,

      - the creation of a cylinder around the STL, with
        an arbitrary number of sector patches,

      - the possibility to add symmetric and oval hills
        to the orography,

      - the option to make the mesh cyclic,

      - the addition of grading stripes in (x,y) directions.

    The workflow is as follows:

      - First set up the dictionary file in your case folder
        'system/terrainBlockMesherDict'. For doing so, copy
        and paste and modify from the tutorials, located at
        'iwesol/iwesolFoamTools/tutorials/terrainBlockMesher'.

      - run 'terrainBlockMesher'. This writes the file
        'constant/polyMesh/blockMeshDict'.

      - run 'blockMesh'.

For installation instructions, consult the file
'iwesol/README_INSTALL'.

Thank you for using IWESOL. Please consider this a beta version and
