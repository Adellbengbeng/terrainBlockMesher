Installation notes for IWESOL - IWES Open Library
Copyright Fraunhofer IWES, Oldenburg, Germany
Date: 11 Feb 2013, author: Jonas Schmidt
---------------------------------------------------

This version was written for and tested on Ubuntu 12.04
with OpenFOAM 2.1.1 and g++ 4.6.3. Compatibility with other 
OS or other versions of Ubuntu, OpenFOAM or compilers are 
not to be expected.

Installation:

(1) Update the paths in the file 'bashrc' in the folder 'iwesol'.

(2) Add the line 'source <path to iwesol>/bashrc' to your 
    ~/.bashrc, and either open a new terminal or 'source ~/.bashrc'.

(3) Change directory to 'iwesol' and type './Allmake'. This should
    compile the libraries and the applications.

(4) Compile the doxygen documentation by typing 
    'doxygen doc/iwesol.cfg' inside the folder 'iwesol'. The index
    file is then created at localtion '$IWESOL_DOC/html/index.html'.

The libraries created from 'iwesolCppLibs' are placed at 
$IWESOL_CPP_LIB. The libraries created form 'iwesolFoamTools' are 
placed at $FOAM_USER_LIBBIN. The applications are placed at 
$FOAM_USER_APPBIN. 

You can find basic examples in the folder 
'iwesol/iwesolFoamTools/tutorials'.

Thank you for using IWESOL. Please consider this a beta version and
